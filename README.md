# Variable importance and Super Learning analysis for HVTN505 correlates of risk

The goal of this work is to perform a Super Learning analysis and variable importance analysis for the HVTN505 data. We want to help identify correlates of risk, using unbiased machine learning rather than pre-specified analysis groups (this analysis complements other analyses that do include pre-specified analysis groups).

The contents of this directory are structured as follows:
* `code/`: contains the code necessary to replicate the analysis, including creating all plots;
* `vignettes/`: contains the most recent build of the vignette, which walks through all of the code and results using a small Super Learner library (for illustration only)
